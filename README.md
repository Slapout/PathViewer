# PathViewer

In Windows it's difficult to view your PATH environmental variable. It displays it all on one line. And while you can view it from a Command Prompt, the entries all run together and this makes it hard to read. 

PathViewer is a simple program that displays a list of the items in your PATH with one entry per line. 

The title bar also shows a count of the number of characters in your PATH.
